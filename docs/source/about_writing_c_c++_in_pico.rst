About Writing C/C++ codes on Raspberry Pi Pico
============================================================

For beginners, writing code for Raspberry Pi Pico in Python, MicroPython or CircuitPython is an easier way to go. 

But, what if you want to write in C/C++? 

The Raspberry Pi officially provides Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK with detailed `documation <https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf>`_, 
which is still not beginner friendly.

While Arduino is an excellent option for beginners who would like to write C/C++. But Arduino is still porting Pico for the Arduino IDE.

Luckily Earle F. Philhower, III published an unofficial support! He has developed the `Raspberry Pi Pico Arduino core <https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico>` to 
add support for the Raspberry Pi Pico to the Arduino IDE.

And then, using this repository,  **tom'sHARDWARE** published a complete tutorial on setting up Arduino IDE for Raspberry Pi Pico on both Windows and Ubuntu.

If you canâ€™t wait for the official one, try it out! As soon as Arduino officially release Raspberry Pi Pico port, we will update detailed lessons.
